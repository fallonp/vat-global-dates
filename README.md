This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

I used standard ES6/7 React, yarn & the following external libraries 
* @wojtekmaj/react-daterange-picker custom date picker component
* Axios for RestAPi access
* Animated.css to jazz things up a little

Considered adding some jest tests but given how small the codebase was I thought this was unnecessary?

Had to find a host that used http (harder these days than it used to be!) since the whathappened API wouldn't work otherwise
