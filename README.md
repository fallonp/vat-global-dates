This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

I used the @wojtekmaj/react-daterange-picker custom date picker component & standard ES6 React 
Axios for RestAPi access
Animated.css to jazz things up a little

Considered adding some jest test but given how small the codebase was I thought this was unecessary?

Had to find a host that used http (harder these days than it used to be!) since the whathappened API wouldn't work otherwise
